:toc:

== Background

In today's competitive landscape, efficiently identifying and engaging with potential leads is crucial for growing businesses. This application aims to streamline the lead discovery process by using AI to search and analyze leads across various data sources, presenting actionable insights on an intuitive dashboard. With you as the primary user, this application will focus on maximizing automation, accuracy in lead scoring, and providing an overview of potential leads through real-time, interactive dashboards.

== Requirements

1. **Must-Have**
   - Enable data extraction from multiple external sources, such as websites, social media platforms, and CRM databases, to gather a wide range of potential leads.
   - Implement AI-driven algorithms to analyze and prioritize leads based on factors such as engagement likelihood, industry relevance, and lead quality.
   - Present insights and lead scores on a user-friendly dashboard with filtering and sorting capabilities for deeper exploration.
  
2. **Should-Have**
   - Allow exporting of lead data and insights in formats like CSV and Excel for further offline analysis.
   - Enable customization of lead-scoring algorithms to adjust parameters according to specific business needs.
  
3. **Could-Have**
   - Integrate with popular CRM tools to sync selected leads directly into a CRM.
   - Include AI-driven predictions of lead conversion probability.

4. **Won't Have** (for initial MVP)
   - Advanced customization of dashboards or data visualization beyond standard filtering and sorting.

== Method

### 2. Data Ingestion Layer

The data ingestion layer will gather information from various external sources and transform it into a consistent format for further analysis. This layer will include:

- **Data Scrapers/API Integrations:**  
  - Set up integrations to pull data from available sources, such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and potentially CRM databases. These integrations can use APIs where available, and scrapers where APIs are limited or unavailable.

- **Data Transformation:**  
  - Clean and preprocess data to ensure consistency (e.g., handling duplicates, filling in missing fields, and normalizing text data). Transformation will focus on aligning data points, such as company names, locations, and lead roles, to prepare them for AI analysis.

### 3. AI Processing Layer

This layer will employ AI models to identify, classify, and prioritize leads based on relevance and engagement probability.

- **Lead Scoring Model:**  
  - A scoring algorithm that assesses each lead's potential based on factors such as job title, industry, company size, and recent online activities. This model may use techniques like logistic regression or gradient boosting to prioritize leads according to engagement likelihood and other parameters.

- **Industry and Engagement Classifiers:**  
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) models trained to classify leads based on industry keywords and assess the likelihood of engagement (e.g., by analyzing recent posts, public comments, and bio descriptions). These classifiers will categorize leads to help filter and sort them on the dashboard.

### 4. Data Storage

A central database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB) will store the processed and scored lead data. This database should be optimized for fast queries, as the dashboard will retrieve real-time insights directly from here.

- **Lead Database Schema (Example):**

| Field           | Type        | Description                                 |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| lead_id         | UUID        | Unique identifier for each lead             |
| name            | String      | Name of the lead                            |
| position        | String      | Job title or role of the lead               |
| company         | String      | Lead's company name                         |
| industry        | String      | Industry classification                     |
| engagement_score| Float       | AI-generated engagement likelihood score    |
| last_activity   | DateTime    | Timestamp of the last public activity       |
| source          | String      | Source platform (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter)   |
| created_at      | DateTime    | Date and time of record creation            |

### 5. Dashboard and Visualization

The dashboard will be the main interface for you to view and interact with the processed lead data.

- **Lead Dashboard Features:**
  - **Filtering and Sorting:** Options to filter leads by score, industry, engagement likelihood, and source.
  - **Lead Detail View:** Clicking on a lead will reveal more information, such as recent activity, role, and company insights.
  - **Export Options:** Allows exporting selected data in CSV/Excel format for offline analysis.

== Implementation

### 1. Backend Development

1. **Set Up Data Ingestion**
   - Implement APIs and scrapers for each data source (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter, CRM databases).
   - Develop ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to pull data from these sources and prepare it for analysis, focusing on cleaning, deduplication, and normalization.
   - Store transformed data in a centralized database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB), following the schema outlined in the Method section.

2. **Implement AI Processing Layer**
   - Develop and train AI models for lead scoring and classification:
     - **Lead Scoring Model:** Use machine learning techniques (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to calculate lead scores based on factors such as engagement and relevance.
     - **Industry and Engagement Classifiers:** Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify leads by industry and predict engagement likelihood.
   - Set up a pipeline to automatically score and classify new leads as they are ingested into the database.

### 2. Frontend Dashboard Development

1. **Design the Lead Dashboard Layout**
   - Use a frontend framework like **React** or **Vue.js** to create an interactive user interface.
   - Implement the card-based layout with tags, colored badges, and metrics to mimic the design style you shared.

2. **Filtering and Sorting Features**
   - Add filtering options to allow users to refine lead lists by tags, source, industry, and engagement scores.
   - Implement sorting options (e.g., by engagement score, most recent activity) for easy prioritization.

### 3. Testing and Quality Assurance

1. **Unit Testing and Integration Testing**
   - Test each backend component (data ingestion, AI scoring) and ensure accurate integration with the frontend.

2. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
   - Conduct UAT to ensure the dashboard meets the original requirements and provides a smooth, intuitive experience for lead discovery.

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize data fetching and rendering times on the dashboard, ensuring quick responses even when large datasets are loaded.
